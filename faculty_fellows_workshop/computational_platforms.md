# Computational Platforms for Programming Lessons

This lesson will cover open and free computational platforms where you might run your programming lessons. 

## Quick Start - Which platform should I use?

The table below gives a comparison of the computational platforms that we will cover in this lesson.
Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best platform for you will depend on your specific needs including the programming language you are using, the software you would like to use, and the level of control you need over the environment.

The most flexible tool among the platforms is *GitHub Codespaces*, but it requires the most configuration.
ChemCompute is the most user-friendly platform and has a wide variety of software suited specifically to molecular sciences pre-installed. 
However, it is not as flexible when it comes to custom software as GitHub Codespaces or Google CoLab.
